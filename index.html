      <p>Hi! My name's Noah. I am currently a student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, a coding school based in Portland, Oregon. I've created this website to showcase some of the projects I've completed there. I graduated from high school in the Spring of 2018 and decided to enroll in Epicodus because I would be able to learn in a much more focused way. I was part of a dual-credit program in high school&mdash;I took classes at Portland Community College, and the credits I earned there counted towards my high school requirements. While I enjoyed my time at PCC, </p>
