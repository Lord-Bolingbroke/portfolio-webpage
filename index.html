      <p>Hi! My name's Noah. I am currently a student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, a coding school based in Portland, Oregon. I've created this website to showcase some of the projects I've completed.
      <p>I graduated from high school in the Spring of 2018. I was part of a dual-credit program called Summit Learning Charter&mdash;in my junior and senior year of high school I was a student at Portland Community College, but the credits I earned there counted towards my high school diploma. While I enjoyed some aspects of PCC, my motivation to study was drained by the inevitable busywork in assignments. I wanted a school program that was more focused, and Epicodus seemed like a good fit.</p>
      <p>I had almost no coding experience when I enrolled at Epicodus&mdash;just a little HTML and CSS froms school. While I was initially concerned about the the program's fast pace, I was encouraged by the emphasis Epicodus placed on having a growth mindset.</p>
      <p>Outside of school/programming, some of my interests include:
        <ul>
          <li>editing Wikipedia (see my edit history <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Lord_Bolingbroke">here</a>);</li>
          <li>exploring Portland by bike;</li>
          <li>and learning about local history.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Week 1 Projects</h2>
        <p>Here's a timeline of the work I've done during my first week at Epicodus. Projects that I think I've completed successfully are highlighted in green. Projects that I think meet the bare minimum standard but could use improvement are highlighted in yellow. Projects that I don't think I've completed successfully are highlighted in red.</p>
